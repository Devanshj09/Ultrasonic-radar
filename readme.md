Building a Ultrasonic sensor radar


The basic idea was to make a radar with a Servo motor and Ultrasonic sensor, where the motor was used to rotate the ultrasonic sensor attached on top of it. 


The most difficult part of this project was to attach the ultrasonic sensor on top of servo motor


According to the project website, the following materials are required: 
- Arduino UNO 
- Electronic testing circuit board 
-Jump wires 
-USB cable for Arduino to computer 
-Micro servo SG90 (9g) 
- TowerPro 
-Ultrasonic sensor hc-sr04


Build Instructions

He final version of my project contains an RGB led with three 2.2k Resistor, piezo speaker , push button to control the RGB led and piezo speaker, Servo motor to move the Ultrasonic sensor attached on top of it to move from minimum angle to maximum angle defined by the user. The images are also included in the final write up to refer to. 

Code 

code has been provided in a zip file along with processing code. 

Team
This was a solo project, hope you like it.
